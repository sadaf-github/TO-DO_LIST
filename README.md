# TO-DO_LIST
I developed this to-do list program using c++ programming.
This is a simple console-based To-Do List application written in C++. It allows users to manage their tasks with functionalities to add, view, and delete tasks.

Features:
Add New Task: Enter a new task to add to your to-do list.
View Tasks: Display all the tasks currently in the to-do list.
Delete Task: Remove a task from the list by specifying its index.
Exit: Terminate the application.
The application uses a fixed-size array of 10 tasks. If the list is full, you will be informed and no additional tasks can be added until space is cleared.
Task indices start from 0.

Requirements:
C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio, etc.)

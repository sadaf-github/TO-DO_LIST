# TO-DO_LIST
I developed this to-do list program using c++ programming.
This is a simple console-based To-Do List application written in C++. It allows users to manage their tasks with functionalities to add, view, and delete tasks.

Features:
Add New Task: Enter a new task to add to your to-do list.
View Tasks: Display all the tasks currently in the to-do list.
Delete Task: Remove a task from the list by specifying its index.
Exit: Terminate the application.

Requirements:
C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio, etc.)
